# Security Policy

## Authentication & Password Security

### Password Hashing
- **Algorithm:** bcrypt (configurable rounds: 12)
- **Salt:** Automatically generated per password
- **Cost Factor:** 12 rounds (intentionally slow to prevent brute-force attacks)
- **Standard Compliance:** OWASP recommended

The SOUL_SENSE_EXAM project uses bcrypt for password hashing instead of SHA-256 to provide industry-standard security:
- Automatic salt generation prevents rainbow table attacks
- Configurable work factor allows future security adjustments
- Built-in protection against GPU-accelerated brute-force attacks
