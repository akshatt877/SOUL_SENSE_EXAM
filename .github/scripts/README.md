# 🛠️ Contributor Scripts

## Overview

This directory contains scripts that help automate contributor coordination.

## Getting Started

Most of these scripts are designed to be run via GitHub Actions. However, if you've forked this repository, you can customize them in your own `.github/workflows/` directory.

## Self-Assignment

The `/assign` and `/take` commands are handled by `.github/workflows/self-assign.yml`. If you want this to work in your fork, make sure your fork has "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" enabled in Settings → Actions → General.

## Coordination

Please use the provided issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` to coordinate with other team members.
